.SH NAME
ios-camera-extractor \- Converts HEIC images to PNG, JPG, and generates a PDF
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ios-camera-extractor
[\fIpattern\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B ios-camera-extractor
script takes a file path or file path matching pattern for images (usually in HEIC format) and:
- Converts the images to PNG and JPG formats.
- Reduces the image resolution to a maximum of 2048px while preserving the aspect ratio.
- Generates a PDF containing the images (two per page) for easy printing.

The script is designed to be called from anywhere in the terminal, and it will create a folder named
.B camera_extractions_{DATE}
with the converted images and the generated PDF.

.SH OPTIONS
The script takes a file pattern as an argument:
.TP
.B pattern
A pattern that matches one or more image files. The pattern must be wrapped in quotes to prevent the shell from expanding it before the script runs. For example:
.BR "IMG_59*" 
will match all images starting with "IMG_59".

Supported pattern types include:
- \fI*.HEIC\fR: Matches all HEIC files in the directory.
- \fIIMG_59*.HEIC\fR: Matches all HEIC files starting with "IMG_59".
- \fIIMG_????.HEIC\fR: Matches files that start with "IMG_" followed by exactly 4 characters (e.g., "IMG_1234.HEIC").

.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
.B "ios-camera-extractor \"IMG_59*\""
Converts all HEIC images that start with "IMG_59" in the current directory.

.TP
.B "ios-camera-extractor \"*.HEIC\""
Converts all HEIC files in the current directory.

.SH NOTES
- Make sure to wrap the file pattern in quotes to prevent the shell from expanding it prematurely.
- The script relies on ImageMagick for conversion and PDF generation, so it must be installed on your system.
- The output folder will be named according to the current date and time in the format "camera_extractions_YYYYMMDDHHMMSS".
- The generated PDF will contain two images per page.
